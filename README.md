Step 1: The project consists of 4 files:-

1)titanic.csv
2)advanced feature engineering
3)Feature Engineering
4)Report File

I have used the Titanic dataset and the file name is titanic.csv 

Step 2: The code is runable and 100 percent working and it is original content that I have tested and the code is working completely fine.
You can open the file Advanced Feature Engineering and can run the code step by step just make sure to ensure the dataset file i.e. titanic.csv is present in the folder and the code is good to go It has an explanation of EDA with supervised learning.

Step 3: The second file is feature engineering in which all the features of dataset has been explained of titanic dataset.
